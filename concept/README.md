# TOUCHING SOUNDS

Exploring the historical evolution of card suit symbolism throughout different eras and regions of the world, unveiling what hides behind the 4 French suit symbols by triggering material, atmospheric sounds. 

### Interaction
Spinning wheels +  sliding fingers on 3d surfaces.

## Description 

- We are working with materials and sounds. 
- We associated a material to each French card suit.
- Through an interactive 3D board, visitors will be able to choose which material timeline they would like to explore by touching an engraved board. 
- They will trigger visual representations of the symbols that hide behind the classical modern french suits that we mostly know of, embarking on a time journey. 
- Each material will trigger a different sound landscape, that the users will be able to modify by touching different parts of the board.
